				<p class="para"><strong>Social Emotional Competence sets the foundation for learning and school

success and can be as good if not a better predictor of school success than 

cognitive ability or academic preparedness.</strong>  Early intervention at a time when 

childre's behavior is the most malleable is the most beneficial means of preventing 

escalating academic problems including grade retention, school drop-out and anti-social 

behavior. <strong>Children are not available for learning if they do not have the skills to 

self-regulate and to manage behaviors or intense feelings.</strong>  Think about yourselves 

when you are struggling with a personal issue; you have a harder time concentrating on 

other things in your life.  </p>

<p class="para">
<strong>A full day kindergarten program would give all students the much needed 

opportunity to develop the skills to self-regulate, to focus their attention and to be 

available for learning as well as to develop the skills to problem solve and 

navigate their social world.</strong>  In this day and age, our children are involved in so many 

adult driven activities vs. child initiated and we are seeing children who increasingly lack 

the skills to manage and resolve conflicts or to cope with strong emotions.  A full day 

program would afford all students more opportunities to work on these critical skills and 

would set the stage for school success.  </p>

<p class="para">
With the rigors of the common core curriculum which is intended to be delivered 

in a full day program but is being implemented in 2 and 3/4 hours, children are not given the 

benefit of time to work on social learning and learning through play which is critical at 

this young age.  The children certainly appear to be feeling the pressure which can only 

lead to an increase in the amount of stress that these children are feeling.  In addition 

<strong>so many of our parents don't have the luxury of staying home with their children 

therefore, many kids are going to two and three different programs in a given day 

which can be very stressful and overwhelming.</strong></p>

<p class="para">

As the Clark School Guidance Counselor I urge you to consider what is in the 

best interest of our children.
