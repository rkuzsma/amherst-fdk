				<h4>Why do we need full day kindergarten?</h4>
				<div class="col-md-10 tech_para">
					<p class="para">We need to give our teachers more time to adequately address the skills and dispositions required for today's students. Today's kindergarteners are facing higher expectations than ever before. Teachers need time to teach and reinforce.</p>
					<p class="para">Full day kindergarten is not about asking teachers and students to do more with the same amount of time. It is about asking teachers and students to do more with more.</p>
					<p class="para">If we truly want to address the development of the <i>whole</i> child we need to be honest with ourselves and build a structure that supports our schools, teachers and students in reaching this goal. Meeting the needs of the whole child would include a balanced focus on the academics including time in social studies and science, as well as the social, emotional, developmental needs of children.</p>
					<p class="para">Full day kindergarten students will have:</p>
					<ul class="para">
						<li>More time to practice and internalize social and academic skills</li>
						<li>More time for social interaction with peers</li>
						<li>Time for opportunities in the creative arts</li>
						<li>More time to engage in small group and individualized instruction</li>
						<li>Time to develop a stronger and interconnected learning community among students, teachers and parents</li>
						<li>Time to address the development of the <i>whole child</i></li>
					</ul>
					<p class="para">Nationally, 82% of all districts offer full day kindergarten. National education standards assume most kindergarteners have already had a full day curriculum. 87+ NH districts already offer fully funded kindergarten. We want to keep Amherst a destination for families who want to raise kids in a great school district.</p>
					<p class="para">Don't reflect upon your own experience as a Kindergartener. It's not the same world; expectations today are far higher.</p>

				<h4>Does the Amherst community support full day kindergarten?</h4>
				<div class="col-md-10 tech_para">
					<p class="para">In a recent <a href="research/Full_Day_K_Pres_Community_Forum 12_9_14.pdf">survey</a> answered by 499 Amherst residents, 74% support offering full day kindergarten in Amherst.</p>
					<p class="para">The Amherst School Board unanimously approved Article 13 to bring full day kindergarten.</p>
					<p class="para">Amherst elementary school teachers believe full day kindergarten is important and necessary.</p>
					<p class="para">The Amherst Ways and Means committee voted 4:3 in favor of full day kindergarten. The 3 representatives not in favor of kindergarten cited a need to see more metrics for the development of social skills at the kindergarten level and how much it will improve throughout the grades.</p>

				<h4>What is the expected enrollment?</h4>
				<div class="col-md-10 tech_para">
					<p class="para">In any given year, we find a 15-25% increase in the number of first graders compared to the number of kindergarteners. Many who join in first grade do so because they had kids involved in alternate kindergarten (full day) elsewhere. We would anticipate an increase in kindergarten compared to prior years.</p>
					<p class="para">With full day kindergarten, next year we expect between 95-105. Right now enrollment is 93 (the lowest enrollment in many years).</p>

					<p class="para">87+ districts across New Hampshire offer full day kindergarten for all students, fully funded by the district.</p>
					<ul class="para">
						<li>Many towns/districts added full day in 2014-2015 (e.g. Hopkinton, Merrimack Valley, Hanover, Governor Wentworth Regional School District)</li>
						<li>More districts hope to implement in the 2015-2016 school year (e.g. Interlakes, Bow, Oyster River)</li>
						<li>Some other districts (fewer than 10) offer limited options for full day (e.g. Bedford, Hollis, Salem, Pelham, Derry)</li>
						<li>There are only 12 districts in MA that do not offer an option for full day kindergarten.</li>
						<li>Mont Vernon will start full day in 2015-2016. Mont Vernon comes into Amherst at 7th grade, so in theory they have had half a school year more than Amherst.</li>

					<h4>Full day kindergarten feels like too much for my child...</h4>
				
					<p class="para"> The reality today is that teachers are implementing a full day curriculum based on state standards in less than a half day. That is causing teachers and students stress and anxiety.</p>
					<p class="para"><a href="http://www.thenewstribune.com/2013/09/01/2760643/schools-get-a-jump-on-all-day.html#storylink=cpy">Some research</a> has shown that the benefits of full-day kindergarten include a smoother transition to first grade, faster acquisition of early literacy skills and fewer behavioral issues. "What we've found through research over the years is that the earliest intervention is the strongest," said Elk Ridge Principal Christi Ellenwood. "Pre-teaching is more effective than providing intervention after the fact."</p>
					<p class="para">A <a href="http://www.nea.org/assets/docs/HE/mf_kadvoguide.pdf">study</a> published by the National Center for Educational Statistics found that after the second year of a full-day kindergarten program, 100 percent of full-day parents and 72 percent of half-day parents noted that, if given the opportunity again, they would have chosen full-day kindergarten for their child.</p>
