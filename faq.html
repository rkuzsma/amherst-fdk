				<h4><span id="2"/>Why do we need full day kindergarten?</h4>
				<div class="col-md-10 tech_para">
					<p class="para">We need to give our teachers more time to adequately address the skills and dispositions required for today's students. Today's kindergarteners are facing higher expectations than ever before. Teachers need time to teach and reinforce.</p>
					<p class="para">Full day kindergarten is not about asking teachers and students to do more with the same amount of time. It is about asking teachers and students to do more with more.</p>
					<p class="para">If we truly want to address the development of the <i>whole</i> child we need to be honest with ourselves and build a structure that supports our schools, teachers and students in reaching this goal. Meeting the needs of the whole child would include a balanced focus on the academics including time in social studies and science, as well as the social, emotional, developmental needs of children.</p>
					<p class="para">Full day kindergarten students will have:</p>
					<ul class="para">
						<li>More time to practice and internalize social and academic skills</li>
						<li>More time for social interaction with peers</li>
						<li>Time for opportunities in the creative arts</li>
						<li>More time to engage in small group and individualized instruction</li>
						<li>Time to develop a stronger and interconnected learning community among students, teachers and parents</li>
						<li>Time to address the development of the <i>whole child</i></li>
					</ul>
					<p class="para">Nationally, 82% of all districts offer full day kindergarten. National education standards assume most kindergarteners have already had a full day curriculum. 94+ NH districts already offer fully funded kindergarten. We want to keep Amherst a destination for families who want to raise kids in a great school district.</p>
					<p class="para">Don't reflect upon your own experience as a Kindergartener. It's not the same world; expectations today are far higher.</p>

					<p class="para">The Amherst Ways and Means committee voted 4:3 in favor of full day kindergarten.

Many who join in first grade do so because they had kids involved in alternate kindergarten (full day) elsewhere. We would anticipate an increase in kindergarten compared to prior years.</p>
					<p class="para">With full day kindergarten, next year we expect between 95-105. Right now enrollment is 93 (the lowest enrollment in many years).</p>

					<ul class="para">

					<div class="technology_list1">
						<h4><span id="11"/>Full day kindergarten feels like too much for my child...</h4>
					
						<p class="para"> The reality today is that teachers are implementing a full day curriculum based on state standards in less than a half day. That is causing teachers and students stress and anxiety.</p>
						<p class="para"><a href="http://www.thenewstribune.com/2013/09/01/2760643/schools-get-a-jump-on-all-day.html#storylink=cpy">Some research</a> has shown that the benefits of full-day kindergarten include a smoother transition to first grade, faster acquisition of early literacy skills and fewer behavioral issues. "What we've found through research over the years is that the earliest intervention is the strongest," said Elk Ridge Principal Christi Ellenwood. "Pre-teaching is more effective than providing intervention after the fact."</p>
						<p class="para">A <a href="http://www.nea.org/assets/docs/HE/mf_kadvoguide.pdf">study</a> published by the National Center for Educational Statistics found that after the second year of a full-day kindergarten program, 100 percent of full-day parents and 72 percent of half-day parents noted that, if given the opportunity again, they would have chosen full-day kindergarten for their child.</p>

				<h4><span id="12"/>Will the full-day Kindergarten program focus on increased academic instruction only?</h4>
				<div class="col-md-10 tech_para">
					<p class="para">No. We are not looking to add more to the rigorous curriculum, rather we are striving to add balance to our childrens' day.</p>
					<p class="para">The full-day program will provide additional instructional time in core areas such as reading, writing, and mathematics and will also provide for additional instruction in areas such as science and social studies. More importantly, the full-day program will allow for a greater focus on the social and emotional development of all children, since students will participate in extended play and recess times, will have lunch at school, and will also be able to participate regularly in programs such as music, art, physical education, and technology. Increased play, social interaction time, and hands-on learning will provide an even balance with academic components of the full-day program.</p>
