			<h2>Response to the Amherst Ways and Means Minority Report</h2>

			<div class="technology_list">
				<div class="col-md-10 tech_para">
					<p class="para">The following is a response to the Ways and Means Minority Report on the Full-Day Kindergarten program. The Minority Report text is quoted in <i>italics</i>.
					</p>

					<p class="para minority_text">[Minority Report] We have been told by the Administration that the transition to a full day kindergarten program is necessary because of the new "Common Core" curriculum requirements.</p>

					<p class="para minority_response">Correction:</p>
 
					<p class="para minority_response">The Common Core State Standards ("CCSS") are not a curriculum. They are a set of standards that detail what students should know and be able to do at the end of each grade level. It is up to local school districts to determine what curriculum will be used to meet the standards.</p>

					<p class="para minority_text">[Minority Report] We disagree with this conclusion for the following six reasons:<br/>
1. The New Hampshire Board of Education does not require full day kindergarten to meet "Common Core" requirements and has issued instructions for "pacing" to integrate the new requirements into a half day program. Also, the state legislature has recently introduced a bill to reverse current curriculum requirements. Why rush into this when future curriculum requirements are in doubt?</p>

					<p class="para minority_response">Correction:</p>
					<p class="para minority_response">The New Hampshire Board of Education has not taken the actions claimed in the Minority Report. This was verified by corresponding with a member of the NH Board of Education.</p>
					<p class="para minority_response">Response:</p>
					<p class="para minority_response">The New Hampshire Department of Education did issue a half-day pacing guide for CCSS in December of 2012, since NH does not require full-day Kindergarten. However, even within this guide, full-day Kindergarten programs are referenced. As noted in the majority report, the CCSS were designed with full-day Kindergarten programs in mind. Seventy-seven percent of Kindergarten students nationwide were in full-day programs as of 2013.</p>
					<p class="para minority_response">Common Core is not a requirement of the NH DOE and the language of both bills dealing with CCSS, Senate Bill 101 and House Bill 276, do not call for the reversal of CCSS, contrary to statements made in the minority report.</p>

					<p class="para minority_text">[Minority Report] 2. A minority of districts statewide have a full day program similar to the wholly taxpayer funded proposal for Amherst. We could find no full day kindergartens in the local area that are solely taxpayer funded.</p>

					<p class="para minority_response">Response:</p>
					<p class="para minority_response">At least 94 communities in NH offer a full-day kindergarten program.</p>
					<p class="para minority_response">As stated during public comment at the deliberative session, the fact that Amherst would be the only community in the immediate area with full-day Kindergarten for all students could give Amherst homes a competitive advantage when families with young children are deciding where to purchase a house. To provide some context about Kindergarten programs in the local area, one nearby community was among the last in the entire State of New Hampshire to implement public Kindergarten in 2009, whereas Amherst implemented Kindergarten in 1997.</p>
					<p class="para minority_response">Senate Bill 228, if passed, would provide the full per-student adequacy aid amount for Kindergarten students -- NH currently only pays half the full amount of adequacy aid for Kindergarten students. Should SB 228 pass, that legislation would actually reduce the property tax impact of the Kindergarten proposal. Furthermore, House Bill 539 would establish a fund in the Department of Education to support early childhood education programs such as full-day Kindergarten.</p>

					<p class="para minority_text">[Minority Report] 3. Allowing additional classroom time for emotional and social development has been proposed as one of the benefits of this program. We feel that while this is extremely important, we question the assertion that the home environment is insufficient to provide for this development. We dispute the suggestion that full day kindergarten would decrease interventions. This is an assertion currently unsupported by relevant studies or data.</p>

					<p class="para minority_response">Correction:</p>
					<p class="para minority_response">The school district makes no assertions about the sufficiency or insufficiency of a home environment to provide emotional and social development.</p>
					<p class="para minority_response">Any such claim or assertion referenced in the minority report was not made at the district's community Kindergarten forum in December, at the public hearing in January, or at the deliberative session in February, nor in any of the proposal documents which have been publicly available on the SAU 39 website since December.</p>
					<p class="para minority_response">In the November 2014 presentation to the Amherst School Board (publicly available on the SAU 39 website), a Hanover Research study from 2010 cited benefits to students such as increased independence in learning, reduced remediation rates, improved student attendance,  increased social and emotional development, and a greater level of classroom involvement, productivity, and ability to reflect.</p>
					<p class="para minority_response">Even for students in full-day Kindergarten, they are still spending more days in a year not in school than they are spending days in school.</p>

					<p class="para minority_text">[Minority Report] 4. Assertions that five-year olds are ready to be placed in an academically rigorous full day kindergarten are questionable. For example, a recent article by Valerie Strauss in The Washington Post (Jan 13, 2015) stated, "Under the Common Core State Standards, the snowball has escalated into an avalanche which threatens to destroy appropriate and effective approaches to early education." This article cited further studies questioning the developmental readiness of some children for the challenges of new curriculum requirements.</p>

					
					<p class="para minority_response">Correction:</p>
					<p class="para minority_response">The full-day proposal is not solely for an academically rigorous full-day program; the full-day proposal allows academics to be spread out over the course of the day, and allows more time for age appropriate play and social-emotional development.</p>
					<p class="para minority_response">Response:</p>
					<p class="para minority_response">The reality is, our five-year olds already are in an academically rigorous environment, and they are learning the skills required. The full-day proposal recognizes that there are other areas besides academic rigor which are also important to early childhood development. Kindergarten teachers both from Clark School and other districts with many years of experience have stated the same at multiple public forums. In addition, the full-day proposal allows additional time for subjects such as Art and Music, which are not currently in the Kindergarten curriculum.</p>
					<p class="para minority_response">Clarification:</p>
					<p class="para minority_response">The quote cited in the online article mentioned above is taken out of context; the online article actually emphasizes the importance of offering time for social-emotional development. The article cites research studies which conclude that kids learn better through play-based learning in a less academically rigorous setting, which is precisely what the full day program will provide.</p>

					<p class="para minority_text">[Minority Report] 5. Long time Amherst residents may recall the "Readiness Program", a program discontinued by the State of New Hampshire more than 20 years ago because it could not be shown to be effective. This was a full day educational curriculum between kindergarten and First Grade, for those deemed not ready for First Grade. In the view of some, this is an effort to duplicate that program. If this program, for a cohort that was one year older than kindergarten age could not be shown to be effective, we question if such a program for five year olds would be effective now.</p>

					<p class="para minority_response">Correction:</p>
					<p class="para minority_response">The Readiness program was not discontinued by the State of New Hampshire (in fact 35 students in New Hampshire are currently in the Readiness Program). In addition, the program was not discontinued "more than 20 years ago", but rather was in place until the Fall of 2003. The Amherst School District decided to discontinue the program not because it was ineffective, but because Amherst's Kindergarten program has proven successful at reducing learning gaps among incoming first graders.</p>

					<p class="para minority_text">[Minority Report] 6. Lastly, the lack of a method to evaluate this program is disturbing. There are no metrics in place to determine if this new curriculum will have a positive impact on our children. We appear to be rushing into a program whose merits we cannot know and whose potential harm we may be unable to reverse. We are asking taxpayers to expend an additional $620,000 this year, and over $550,000 per year in the future, to support a proposal with no plan to determine its success or failure. If this program should fail to meet expectations, we will have squandered years of our children's educational experience and millions of our tax dollars.</p>

					<p class="para minority_response">Correction:</p>
					<p class="para minority_response">This issue was addressed at the January school board meeting. The district already has several methods (including several national assessment tools) currently in place to measure what current Kindergarten students know and are able to do. Furthermore, school board members will review the Kindergarten program on a regular basis.</p>
					<p class="para minority_response">Response:</p>
					<p class="para minority_response">The elected members of the Amherst School District have a responsibility to review and provide oversight of the curriculum and programming of the Amherst School District (PreK-8). School board members regularly review educational programs, seeking the input of parents, teachers, principals, assistant principals, the SAU curriculum office and the Superintendent of Schools. All review of district programming and curriculum is conducted at monthly school board meetings which are open to the public, are televised, and for which minutes are made publicly available on the SAU website. Anyone attending these meetings will likely recognize that the elected school board officials are active members of the community, who have children in the school system, are aware of what happens in Amherst schools, and ask tough questions.</p>
					<p class="para minority_response">Neither the school board nor the Ways and Means committee have found nor presented any data or research indicating that the full-day Kindergarten proposal, a program which offers students additional time to practice academics, adds music, art, and physical education classes back into the curriculum, and adds time for play and social development, would cause any irreversible damage to our children. On the contrary, this claim seems wildly at odds with the experiences of parents whose students have been or are currently in the Kindergarten program at Clark school since 1997.</p>
					<p class="para minority_response">To be clear, a proposal to implement full-day Kindergarten means adding an additional three hours to the school day for students in one grade only. How the minority report equates this to squandering "years" of childrens' education is unclear. Full-day Kindergarten is not new to New Hampshire, with at least 94 school districts currently offering full-day programs. Nationally, since 1977 the percentage of Kindergarteners enrolled in full-day programs has increased from 28% to 77% according to a report published by Child Trends.</p>
